For a more traditional engineering challenge, my senior design proposed the design of a mechanical piston to harness kinetic energy from hurricane waves while protecting levee walls along coastlines from repeated wave impacts. A portion of this kinetic energy is transferred to a hydroelectric generator place arranged behind the levee wall, connected via a running pipe that can link multiple plates.

We modeled and constructed a prototype for a piston system using a curved plate to absorb the impact energy of hurricane force waves. We were able to test the proof of concept device at the University of Pittsburgh in a custom water tank built to simulate waves and confirmed that electricity was generated by successfully lit a series of LEDs. This idea of implementing passive devices to generate electricity and reduce damage to coastlines underscores the role of engineers and researchers to tackle society’s energy challenges.
