title: "Bipedal Robot Foot Stiffness"
excerpt: "Designed, fabricated, and tested damped feet for the bipedal robot RAMone to improve walking performance<br/><img src='/images/ramone.png'>"
collection: portfolio
---
Constructed a drop test rig and performed walk tests on RAMone to compare performance
Improved stability at high walking speeds through selection of elastomers and 3D printed
photopolymers
Extended maximum walking speed and lowered cost of transport by increasing foot damping and
stiffness
Published and presented results at International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
2019

At lower cable tensions, little drift compensation is required for unpowered systems. This enables smaller and lighter systems that require less power to operate than conventional exosuits.
