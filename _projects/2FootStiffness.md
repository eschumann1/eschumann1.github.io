Pursuing an internship at the University of Michigan, I developed my passion for designing and testing robotic systems at Dr. C. David Remyâ€™s Robotics and Motion Lab. The goal of my project was to generate new foot designs to improve the walking performance of the planar bipedal robot RAMone.

At high speeds, the robot experienced destabilizing foot vibrations that made it difficult to control and often led to falls as seen here.

I proposed to improve stability by implementing highly damped materials to reduce the amplitude and occurrence of foot bounces. My method was to generate a variety of soft foot designs, design a custom drop testing rig to study their bouncing behavior by simulating impact during each step.

My results support both high damping and stiffness in the foot to achieve stability at high speeds while remaining energy efficient. Here Neoprene is used to provide high damping and stiffness effects in the feet.

I published and presented results at International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
2019 where further details can be found.
