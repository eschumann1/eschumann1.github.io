At Carnegie Mellon University's Robomechanics Lab, I developed trotting simulations of a quadrupedal robot in Pybullet based on Ghost Roboticsâ€™ Spirit 40 quadruped. Inspired by desirable results from the MIT Cheetah 3 quadruped, I investigated the viability of using model predictive control as a low-level controller for legged locomotion. I gradually progressed the robot simulation in PyBullet from standing to trotting the robot by developing controllers for stance and swing phases of the respective legs during the gait cycle. I implemented torque control using model predictive control to optimize for desired ground reaction forces during the stance phase.
