The goal of this project is to reduce exosuit component drift in a passive spring system for hip flexion by placing a lower power motor in series with  the spring to adjust tension over time and maintain constant torque on the hip joint.

At lower cable tensions, little drift compensation is required for unpowered systems. This enables smaller and lighter systems that require less power to operate than conventional exosuits.
