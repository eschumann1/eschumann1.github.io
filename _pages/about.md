My interests lie within the design and control of robotic systems and I have pursued a depth of robotics research areas across Harvard University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Michigan. Additionally, I have extensive industry experience from both robotics start-ups and more well established engineering companies in the Pittsburgh, PA region. I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in 2018 and my M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard University in 2021.
