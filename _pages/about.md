My interests lie within the design and control of robotic systems and I have pursued a variety of robotics research at Harvard University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Michigan. I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Pittsburgh in 2018. Currently, I expect to receive my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a robotics focus from Harvard University in March 2021.
